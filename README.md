# Block 24, Intro to React, Workshop: Puppy Pals
In this workshop, we will learn the basics of manipulating data in React. So far, we have used React via a CDN. But from now on, we will use npm to create our front-end React applications.

# terms: React, npm, Node.js, vite, and useState...

Install Node.js. Use the official React documentation. It recommends using a framework like Remix or Next JS to start a project. Although both are terrific frameworks, we do not yet need that much complexity in our applications. So instead, we will use a tool named Vite to help us build our project.

What Is Vite?
Vite uses tools in the background to bundle all our JavaScript files together, to transpile our JavaScript code, to manage packages that we might download through npm, and more.

In this workshop, we will use a list of furry friends as our data. And, we will learn how to work with the useState hook to render that data in the browser.
